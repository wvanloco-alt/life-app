# API Routes Contract: Life App

> Last updated: 2026-05-19. Reflects current API surface including Feature 1, Feature 2 (Activities), Feature 3 (Budget), v2 Overhaul, Goals V2 (goal hierarchy, tallies, pace tracking), Scheduler Rules (blackout dates, session patterns, activity type propagation), **training vs supplemental split (climbing phases + scheduler + apply)**, **Activities Refactoring V1** (`isLogEntry` → `createdFromLog`, schedule-to-log bridge on activity check-off, `bridgedLogAction` on un-check / delete, `linkedLogId` on activity GET, `defaultDurationMinutes` on activity types, explicit `goalId` from WorkoutLog), schedule regeneration/reset, UI Design Overhaul (cascade delete, activity summary extension), **Role Scheduling Rules Removal** (dropped scheduling fields from roles, `sessionsPerWeek` server-side clamp `[1, 7]`), **Habit Tracking Phase 1** (`/api/habits`, `/api/habit-logs`), and **Library Phase 1** (`/api/library/topics`, `/api/library/topics/[slug]`). Onboarding Wizard removed.

All API routes use Next.js Route Handlers. Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api`

All responses are JSON. All dates are ISO 8601 format.

## Activity Types

Activity types define trackable activities (e.g., Running, Tennis, Reading, Meditation).

### GET /api/activity-types

Returns all activity types.

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Running",
    "type": "cardio",
    "icon": "🏃",
    "isTracked": true,
    "defaultCalories": null,
    "defaultSteps": null,
    "defaultDurationMinutes": 60,
    "metricsConfig": [
      { "key": "distance_km", "label": "Distance (km)", "type": "number" },
      { "key": "pace", "label": "Pace (min/km)", "type": "text" }
    ],
    "variants": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

`defaultDurationMinutes` (Activities Refactoring V1) is the value the schedule-to-log bridge uses for `durationMinutes` when auto-inserting an activity log on check-off of a scheduled activity of this type.

### POST /api/activity-types

Create a new activity type.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Meditation",
  "type": "mindfulness",
  "icon": "🧘",
  "isTracked": true,
  "defaultCalories": null,
  "defaultSteps": null,
  "defaultDurationMinutes": 30,
  "metricsConfig": [],
  "variants": null
}
```

`defaultDurationMinutes` is optional on create; it must be a positive integer when provided and defaults to `60` if omitted. Activities Refactoring V1.

**Response** `201`: The created activity type object.

### PATCH /api/activity-types/:id

Update an activity type. Accepts any subset of fields. When `defaultDurationMinutes` is provided it must be a positive integer.

### DELETE /api/activity-types/:id

Delete an activity type.

---

## Activity Logs

Activity logs replace the former Workouts entity. They record completed activities and can optionally link to goals and calendar entries.

### GET /api/activity-logs

Returns activity logs with joined `activityTypeName`, `activityTypeIcon`. Accepts query params:
- `?activityTypeId=1` — filter by activity type
- `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — filter by exact date (v2)
- `?from=YYYY-MM-DD` / `?to=YYYY-MM-DD` — date range
- `?limit=100` — max results (default 100)

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "activityTypeId": 1,
    "goalId": 1,
    "activityId": 5,
    "date": "2026-03-04",
    "durationMinutes": 45,
    "calories": 380,
    "steps": null,
    "variant": null,
    "metrics": { "distance_km": 5.2, "pace": "5:30", "heart_rate": 155 },
    "notes": "Easy morning run",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-04T08:00:00.000Z",
    "activityTypeName": "Running",
    "activityTypeIcon": "🏃"
  }
]
```

### POST /api/activity-logs

Log a new activity. When `goalId` is provided, auto-creates or updates a calendar activity (marks existing uncompleted activity as completed, or creates new one with `createdFromLog=true`; field renamed from `isLogEntry` in Activities Refactoring V1). **v2**: After creating the log, auto-completes any matching scheduled activity (same `activityTypeId`, same date, not yet completed).

**Activities Refactoring V1**: The in-app WorkoutLog tab now exposes an "(optional) Goal" picker populated from `GET /api/goals?status=active`. The selected `goalId` is sent verbatim on this POST, replacing the previous behavior where logs were never linked to a goal. Logs created elsewhere (calendar check-off via the schedule-to-log bridge) continue to inherit `goalId` from the source activity.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "activityTypeId": 1,
  "goalId": 1,
  "date": "2026-03-04",
  "durationMinutes": 45,
  "calories": 380,
  "steps": null,
  "variant": null,
  "metrics": { "distance_km": 5.2, "pace": "5:30", "heart_rate": 155 },
  "notes": "Easy morning run"
}
```

`activityTypeId` is required. `goalId` is optional.

**Response** `201`: The created activity log with joined fields.

### PATCH /api/activity-logs/:id

Update an activity log. Accepts any subset of fields.

### DELETE /api/activity-logs/:id

Delete an activity log.

---

## Body Metrics

### GET /api/body-metrics

Returns body metric entries. Accepts query params:
- `?type=weight` / `vo2max` / `resting_hr` — filter by metric type
- `?from=YYYY-MM-DD` / `?to=YYYY-MM-DD` — date range

### POST /api/body-metrics

Log a new measurement.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-04",
  "metricType": "weight",
  "value": 75.5,
  "unit": "kg"
}
```

**Response** `201`: The created body metric entry.

---

## Activities Summary

### GET /api/activities/summary

Aggregated activities dashboard data. Accepts `?weeks=8` (default 8). Renamed from `/api/fitness/summary` in v2.

**Response** `200`:
```json
{
  "volumeData": [
    {
      "week": "2026-02-24",
      "activities": [{ "minutes": 180, "activityTypeName": "Running", "activityTypeIcon": "🏃", "activityTypeId": 1 }],
      "totalMinutes": 240
    }
  ],
  "streaks": [
    { "activityTypeId": 1, "activityTypeName": "Running", "activityTypeIcon": "🏃", "currentStreak": 4 }
  ],
  "latestBodyMetrics": {
    "weight": { "value": 75.5, "unit": "kg", "date": "2026-03-04", "trend": -0.5 }
  },
  "activityByType": [
    { "name": "Running", "count": 8 },
    { "name": "Tennis", "count": 4 }
  ],
  "recentActivityLogs": [],
  "totalActivityLogs": 42,
  "totalMinutes": 2100,
  "totalCalories": 18500
}
```

`activityByType` provides a breakdown of activity log counts per activity type for the current month, used by the Activities Dashboard bar chart.

---

## Goals

Goals are standalone entities, not owned by weekly plans. They can belong to multiple roles via the `goalRoles` junction table. Goals now support target metrics for progress tracking.

### GET /api/goals

Returns goals with `activityTypeId`, `targetMetric`, `targetValue`, `targetPeriod`, `activityTypeName`, `activityTypeIcon`. Accepts query params:
- `?status=active` (default) / `completed` / `archived` / `all`
- `?roleId=3` — filter to goals belonging to this role
- `?horizon=yearly|monthly|standalone` — **[Goals V2]** filter by horizon. `standalone` returns goals where `horizon IS NULL`
- `?parentId=5` — **[Goals V2]** return only monthly sub-goals for the given yearly goal id
- `?month=2026-03` — **[Goals V2]** return only monthly goals for the given month

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Run a half marathon",
    "description": "Train for the spring race",
    "quadrant": "Q2",
    "targetDate": "2026-06-01",
    "sessionsPerWeek": 4,
    "activityTypeId": 1,
    "targetMetric": "durationMinutes",
    "targetValue": 180,
    "targetPeriod": "week",
    "activityTypeName": "Running",
    "activityTypeIcon": "🏃",
    "status": "active",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "horizon": "yearly",
    "parentGoalId": null,
    "month": null,
    "targetUnit": "km",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z",
    "roles": [
      { "id": 2, "name": "Athlete", "color": "#EF4444" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note: `horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, and `targetUnit` are null for existing standalone goals.

Note: `quadrant` is derived from `targetDate` at read time (≤7 days = Q1, else Q2). Not stored in the database.

### POST /api/goals

Create a new goal.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "title": "Run a half marathon",
  "description": "Train for the spring race",
  "roleIds": [2, 6],
  "targetDate": "2026-06-01",
  "sessionsPerWeek": 4,
  "activityTypeId": 1,
  "targetMetric": "durationMinutes",
  "targetValue": 180,
  "targetPeriod": "week",
  "horizon": "yearly",
  "parentGoalId": null,
  "month": null,
  "targetUnit": "km"
}
```

`activityTypeId`, `targetMetric`, `targetValue`, `targetPeriod` are optional (for metric-based goals).
`horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, `targetUnit` are optional (Goals V2). Omit for backward-compatible standalone goals.

`sessionsPerWeek` is clamped server-side to `[1, 7]`: integers outside the range are pulled in, fractional values are rounded then clamped, and non-numeric input falls back to the default of 3. The client form enforces the same bounds; the server clamp is the belt-and-braces for direct API callers.

**Response** `201`: The created goal with derived quadrant and roles attached.

### PATCH /api/goals/:id

Update a goal. Accepts: `title`, `description`, `targetDate`, `sessionsPerWeek`, `status`, `isCompleted`, `roleIds`, `activityTypeId`, `targetMetric`, `targetValue`, `targetPeriod`, `horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, `targetUnit`.

`sessionsPerWeek`, when provided, is clamped server-side to `[1, 7]` using the same rules as POST. Non-numeric or non-finite input is dropped (treated as "no change") rather than coerced.

### DELETE /api/goals/:id

Delete a goal, its `goalRoles` entries, and (for yearly goals) all linked monthly sub-goals and their role associations.

### GET /api/goals/:id/progress

Returns progress for a goal. Behavior depends on goal type:
- **Metric-based**: sums the relevant metric from activity logs within the current period.
- **Session-based**: counts logs for current week vs `sessionsPerWeek`.
- **Tally-based** (Goals V2): sums `goal_tallies.count` for the current period.
- **Yearly horizon** (Goals V2): aggregates progress from direct logs/tallies AND from all monthly sub-goals. Returns `paceStatus`.

**Response** `200`:
```json
{
  "current": 4,
  "target": 12,
  "percentage": 33,
  "period": "yearly",
  "metricLabel": "books",
  "paceStatus": "ahead",
  "elapsedPercentage": 25
}
```

`paceStatus` and `elapsedPercentage` are only present for goals with `horizon = 'yearly'`. `paceStatus` is one of: `'ahead'` | `'on_track'` | `'behind'` | `'no_data'`.

### GET /api/goals/:id/children `[Goals V2]`

Returns all monthly sub-goals for a yearly goal, each with inline progress data.

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 12,
    "title": "Read 1 book",
    "month": "2026-03",
    "targetValue": 1,
    "sessionsPerWeek": 2,
    "progress": { "current": 1, "target": 1, "percentage": 100 }
  }
]
```

---

## Goal Tallies `[Goals V2]`

Simple count-based progress entries for goals that do not require activity type tracking. The tally `count` is always in the same unit as the goal's `targetUnit` -- if the goal is "Run 500 km" (`targetUnit: "km"`), a tally of `count: 5` means 5 km. Tallies and activity-log metrics contribute to the same cumulative total.

### GET /api/goal-tallies

Returns tally entries. Accepts query params:
- `?goalId=5` — filter by goal (required or strongly recommended)
- `?from=YYYY-MM-DD` / `?to=YYYY-MM-DD` — date range

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "goalId": 5,
    "date": "2026-03-10",
    "count": 1,
    "notes": "Finished Atomic Habits",
    "createdAt": "2026-03-10T20:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### POST /api/goal-tallies

Log a tally entry.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "goalId": 5,
  "date": "2026-03-10",
  "count": 1,
  "notes": "Finished Atomic Habits"
}
```

`goalId` and `date` are required. `count` defaults to 1. `notes` is optional.

**Response** `201`: The created tally entry.

### DELETE /api/goal-tallies/:id

Delete a tally entry.

**Response** `200`: `{ "success": true }`

---

## Roles

### GET /api/roles

Returns all active roles (add `?archived=true` to include archived).

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Professional",
    "description": "Career and work goals",
    "color": "#3B82F6",
    "displayOrder": 0,
    "isArchived": false,
    "isWorkRole": true,
    "createdAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### POST /api/roles

Create a new role.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "name": "Athlete",
  "description": "Fitness and sports",
  "color": "#EF4444",
  "isWorkRole": false
}
```

**Response** `201`: The created role object.

### PATCH /api/roles/:id

Update a role. Accepts any subset of: `name`, `description`, `color`, `displayOrder`, `isArchived`, `isWorkRole`.

### PUT /api/roles/reorder

Reorder all roles.

**Request body**:
```json
{ "order": [3, 1, 4, 2, 5] }
```

---

## Habits

Habits represent daily behaviours the user is building, framed using *Atomic Habits* identity language. Phase 1 (foundation) is merged; the UI ships in Phase 2.

### GET /api/habits

Returns active habits for the authenticated user (`is_archived = 0`), ordered by `displayOrder` ascending. Each habit includes `recentLogDates`: deduplicated ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` strings from the last 30 days (sorted ascending). The server does **not** compute streaks — the client calls `computeStreaks(recentLogDates, today)` locally.

Add `?archived=true` to return archived habits instead (same shape).

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "userId": "abc123",
    "identity": "I am a person who moves their body every day",
    "name": "Morning run",
    "cue": "After I wake up and brew coffee",
    "minimumVersion": "Put on running shoes and walk to the end of the street",
    "color": "#10B981",
    "displayOrder": 0,
    "isArchived": false,
    "createdAt": "2026-05-15 08:00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2026-05-15 08:00:00",
    "recentLogDates": ["2026-05-13", "2026-05-14", "2026-05-15"]
  }
]
```

### POST /api/habits

Create a new habit. `displayOrder` is server-computed (`max + 1` across all habits for the user).

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "identity": "I am a person who moves their body every day",
  "name": "Morning run",
  "cue": "After I wake up and brew coffee",
  "minimumVersion": "Put on running shoes and walk to the end of the street",
  "color": "#10B981"
}
```

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | Yes | 1-200 chars |
| `name` | Yes | 1-50 chars |
| `cue` | No | 0-200 chars, nullable |
| `minimumVersion` | No | 0-200 chars, nullable |
| `color` | Yes | Valid hex `#RRGGBB` |

**Response** `201`: The created habit object (without `recentLogDates` — use `GET /api/habits` for the full wire shape).

### PATCH /api/habits/:id

Partial update. Accepts any subset of `identity`, `name`, `cue`, `minimumVersion`, `color`, `isArchived`, `displayOrder`. Same per-field validation as POST. Returns `404` if the habit does not exist for the authenticated user (never `403` — do not reveal existence to other users).

**Response** `200`: The updated habit row.

### DELETE /api/habits/:id

Hard-deletes the habit. The foreign-key cascade in `apply-schema.js` removes all associated `habit_logs` rows automatically. Returns `404` for unknown or cross-user IDs.

**Response** `204`: No content.

### PUT /api/habits/reorder

Reorder active habits. Validates the entire array before writing — if any ID is unknown, archived, or not owned by the user, the request is rejected with `400` and zero rows are updated.

**Request body**:
```json
{ "order": [3, 1, 4, 2] }
```

**Response** `204`: No content.

---

## Habit Logs

One completion record per habit per calendar day. Both endpoints are idempotent so the client can call them optimistically without checking existing state first.

### POST /api/habit-logs

Log a habit as done for a given date. **Idempotent**: if the `(habitId, date)` pair already exists, the server returns `201` with the existing row rather than `409`. The unique index on `habit_logs (habit_id, date)` is the authoritative enforcement mechanism — concurrent requests are safe.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "habitId": 1,
  "date": "2026-05-15"
}
```

`date` must be a valid ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar date (validated by round-trip check, not just regex). The client is responsible for sending its local calendar date — the server never infers "today".

**Response** `201`: The created (or already-existing) `habit_logs` row.
**Response** `400`: Missing or invalid `habitId` / `date`.
**Response** `404`: `habitId` does not belong to the authenticated user.

### DELETE /api/habit-logs

Un-log a habit for a given date. **Idempotent**: always returns `204`, even if no row matched. The client does not need to confirm the row existed before calling this.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "habitId": 1,
  "date": "2026-05-15"
}
```

**Response** `204`: No content (whether a row was deleted or not).
**Response** `400`: Missing or invalid `habitId` / `date`.
**Response** `404`: `habitId` does not belong to the authenticated user.

---

## Weekly Plans

### GET /api/weekly-plans?week=YYYY-MM-DD

Get or auto-create a weekly plan for the given Monday. If no plan exists, one is created.

**Response** `200`: The weekly plan object.

### PATCH /api/weekly-plans

Update planning notes or isPlanned status.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "weekStartDate": "2026-03-02",
  "planningNotes": "Focus on...",
  "isPlanned": true
}
```

---

## Weekly Focus Goals

Manages which goals are "in focus" for a given week. Goals must already exist in the `goals` table.

### GET /api/weekly-plans/:weekStartDate/goals

Returns all focus goals for the week, with roles and derived quadrant attached.

**Response** `200`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "focusId": 5,
    "title": "Run a half marathon",
    "quadrant": "Q2",
    "targetDate": "2026-06-01",
    "status": "active",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "roles": [{ "id": 2, "name": "Athlete", "color": "#EF4444" }]
  }
]
```

### POST /api/weekly-plans/:weekStartDate/goals

Add an existing goal to this week's focus.

**Request body**:
```json
{ "goalId": 1 }
```

**Response** `201`: The created focus link.
**Response** `409`: Goal is already in focus for this week.

### DELETE /api/weekly-plans/:weekStartDate/goals?goalId=1

Remove a goal from this week's focus.

---

## Activities

Calendar entries. Can be created manually or auto-created when logging via `/api/activity-logs` with a `goalId`.

### GET /api/activities

Get activities. Requires one of:
- `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — single day
- `?weekStart=YYYY-MM-DD` — full week (7 days from Monday)

Response includes joined `roleName`, `roleColor`, `createdFromLog` (true when created from an activity log; renamed from `isLogEntry` in Activities Refactoring V1), **`sessionType`** (`training` \| `supplemental`), and **`linkedLogId`** (`number \| null`). `linkedLogId` is derived via a user-scoped `LEFT JOIN` on `activity_logs.activity_id` and is non-null when the activity is bidirectionally linked to a logged workout. The schedule-to-log bridge's idempotency guarantee (at most one log per activity) keeps the join safe for the activity row's lifetime; the client uses `linkedLogId` to decide whether to prompt the user before un-checking or deleting (Activities Refactoring V1).

### POST /api/activities

Create an activity.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "title": "Morning run",
  "quadrant": "Q2",
  "activityDate": "2026-03-03",
  "startTime": "07:00",
  "endTime": "08:00",
  "roleId": 2,
  "goalId": 1,
  "notes": "Easy pace",
  "createdFromLog": false,
  "sessionType": "training"
}
```

`createdFromLog` is optional (default false). Set to `true` when the activity was created from logging via `/api/activity-logs`. The log-to-activity bridge in `POST /api/activity-logs` sets this flag automatically.

The response shape matches `GET /api/activities`; for a freshly-created activity `linkedLogId` is always `null`.

`sessionType` is optional on create (default `training`). Must be `training` or `supplemental` when provided.

### PATCH /api/activities/:id

Update an activity (reschedule, complete, add notes, etc.). Omitted fields are unchanged (e.g. drag-reschedule sends only `activityDate`).

**Schedule-to-log bridges** (Activities Refactoring V1) — fire when the PATCH transitions `isCompleted`:

- **Check-off transition** (`isCompleted` flips `false → true`): if the activity has an `activityTypeId`, the handler idempotently inserts a row into `activity_logs` with `activityId` set to this activity, `activityTypeId` and `goalId` copied from the activity, `durationMinutes` from `activity_types.default_duration_minutes` (default `60` when missing), and `date` set to `activityDate`. The insert is skipped if a matching log already exists, if `activityTypeId` is null, or if the referenced activity type is not visible to the user (defensive FK check). The transition is detected using the same boolean coercion that the update uses, so client payloads with non-boolean truthy values (`1`, `"true"`) behave consistently.
- **Un-check transition** (`isCompleted` flips `true → false`): the body must include **`bridgedLogAction`** when a linked log exists. Allowed values: `"delete"` (removes the linked log) or `"unlink"` (clears `activity_logs.activity_id` and `activity_logs.goal_id` on the linked log so the workout history is preserved but no longer counts toward the goal). Missing or unrecognized `bridgedLogAction` is treated as no-op for forward compatibility. The client (`LinkedLogActionDialog`) determines whether to surface the prompt based on the `linkedLogId` it already has from GET — optimistic flow, no extra round-trip.

Optional **`sessionType`**: `training` \| `supplemental` — used when editing session type from the activity form.

### DELETE /api/activities/:id

Delete an activity.

**Bridged delete** (Activities Refactoring V1): when the activity has a linked activity log, the handler requires a query parameter **`?bridgedLogAction=delete|unlink`** describing what to do with the linked log first.

- `?bridgedLogAction=delete` — deletes the linked log, then deletes the activity.
- `?bridgedLogAction=unlink` — clears the log's `activity_id` and `goal_id` (preserving the workout history) before deleting the activity.
- If the activity has a linked log and the parameter is missing or unrecognized, the handler responds **`409 Conflict`** with `{ "linkedLogId": <number> }`; the client uses this to open the `LinkedLogActionDialog` and retry with the chosen action. Activities with no linked log delete cleanly with no parameter required.

---

## Recurring Activities

### GET /api/recurring-activities

Get all recurring activities, with joined `roleName` and `roleColor`.

### POST /api/recurring-activities

Create a recurring activity template.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "roleId": 3,
  "title": "Tennis",
  "quadrant": "Q2",
  "dayOfWeek": 2,
  "startTime": "18:00",
  "endTime": "20:00"
}
```

### PATCH /api/recurring-activities/:id

Update or pause a recurring activity.

### DELETE /api/recurring-activities/:id

Delete a recurring activity.

---

## Schedule Generation

### POST /api/schedule/generate

Generate a proposed schedule based on focus goals, existing activities, recurring events, roles, and scheduler settings.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "weekStartDate": "2026-03-02",
  "scope": "month",
  "regenerate": true,
  "month": "2026-03"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `weekStartDate` | Yes | Monday of the week (used for weekly plan / focus goals lookup) |
| `scope` | No | `"week"` (default) or `"month"` |
| `regenerate` | No | When `true`, ignores existing scheduler-generated activities for focus goals so the schedule is built from scratch. Default `false`. |
| `month` | No | `"YYYY-MM"` format. Used when `scope = "month"` to ensure the correct calendar month is targeted, regardless of which day-of-week the 1st falls on. |

**Response** `200`:
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "title": "Run a half marathon",
      "quadrant": "Q2",
      "activityDate": "2026-03-03",
      "startTime": "06:00",
      "endTime": "07:00",
      "roleId": 2,
      "goalId": 1,
      "activityTypeId": 1,
      "roleName": "Athlete",
      "roleColor": "#EF4444",
      "reason": "Session 1/4 — personal time",
      "notes": "…",
      "sessionType": "training"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": ["Could only fit 2/4 sessions for \"Learn Python\""],
  "summary": "Generated 12 activities across 3 goals for the month. Q2 focus: 75%. Spread across 20 days.",
  "regenerate": true,
  "focusGoalIds": [1, 5],
  "dateRange": { "start": "2026-03-01", "end": "2026-03-31" }
}
```

When `regenerate` is `true`, the response includes `focusGoalIds` and `dateRange` metadata. These are passed to the apply endpoint to identify which old activities should be replaced.

**Scheduler algorithm phases**:
1. Classify each day as work/weekend with time windows
2. Calculate sessions needed per goal (`sessionsPerWeek × numWeeks - existing`) -- **[Goals V2]** if a monthly sub-goal exists for the current month, use its `sessionsPerWeek` instead. When `regenerate = true`, existing scheduler-generated activities for focus goals are excluded from the count.
3. Sort goals by urgency (Q1 first, then Q2, then nearest target date)
4. Round-robin placement respecting: work/personal windows, rest-day constraints, max weekly occurrences, no same-day repeats, spread across days
5. Generate summary and warnings

**[Goals V2]** When a focus goal has a monthly sub-goal for the current month, the `reason` field in the generated activity will note: `"Using March benchmark: 5 sessions/week"`.

**[Training vs supplemental V1]** When a focus goal has an **active** training plan, the handler loads split counts, preferred weekday arrays, and phase **layer** columns. `generateSchedule` receives a per-goal split map; each proposed activity includes **`sessionType`**: `"training"` or `"supplemental"`. Training sessions are placed first each ISO week up to `trainingSessionsPerWeek`, then supplemental up to `supplementalSessionsPerWeek`. Notes use `sportFocusContent` + `mentalGameContent` for training, `supplementalContent` for supplemental, with fallback to full `description`. Goals without a plan keep `sessionType: "training"`.

### POST /api/schedule/apply

Apply a generated schedule by creating all proposed activities. Each activity inherits `activityTypeId` from its linked goal (enabling correct activity type display and matching with activity logs) and **`sessionType`** from the proposal (`training` or `supplemental`, defaulting to `training` if omitted). When `regenerate` is `true`, deletes old scheduler-generated activities (non-logged, non-completed) for the specified focus goals within the date range before inserting new ones.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "activities": [ /* ProposedActivity[] from generate response */ ],
  "regenerate": true,
  "focusGoalIds": [1, 5],
  "dateRange": { "start": "2026-03-01", "end": "2026-03-31" }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `activities` | Yes | Array of proposed activities to create |
| `regenerate` | No | When `true`, deletes old scheduled activities before inserting. Default `false`. |
| `focusGoalIds` | No | Goal IDs whose old activities should be replaced (only used when `regenerate = true`) |
| `dateRange` | No | Date range for deletion (`{ start, end }`, only used when `regenerate = true`) |

**Response** `201`:
```json
{
  "created": 12,
  "deleted": 8,
  "activities": [ /* created Activity objects */ ]
}
```

### POST /api/schedule/reset

Remove all scheduled (non-logged, non-completed) activities within a date range. Used to clear the month before regenerating a fresh schedule. Preserves manually logged activities and completed activities.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "start": "2026-03-01",
  "end": "2026-03-31"
}
```

**Response** `200`:
```json
{
  "deleted": 24

## Training plans (periodization + split)

Multi-sport training plans share `GET/POST/DELETE` on `/api/training-plans` plus assess-level, phase transition, restart, refresh-descriptions, and **split editing** for an existing plan.

### GET /api/training-plans?goalId={id}

Returns the plan for that goal or `null`. Response includes `sportProfile` as a parsed object and **`trainingPreferredDays` / `supplementalPreferredDays` as number arrays** (parsed from stored JSON strings). Includes `phases` ordered by `orderIndex`.

### POST /api/training-plans

Creates a plan for `goalId` (409 if one already exists). Body includes `sport`, `yearsExperience`, `startDate`, `sportProfile`, and optionally:
