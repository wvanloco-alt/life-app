## Goals V2: Hierarchy, Dashboard & Flexible Tracking

**Spec**: `.specify/specs/goals-v2/spec.md`
**Status**: Built (all phases complete)

---

### Phase 1: Schema & Types

> Objective: Add new columns to `goals`, create `goal_tallies` table, push schema, update TypeScript types. No UI changes. All existing data preserved.

- [ ] Add four nullable columns to `goals` table in `src/db/schema.ts`:
  - `horizon`: `text("horizon")` -- values: `'yearly'` | `'monthly'` | null
  - `parentGoalId`: `integer("parent_goal_id").references(() => goals.id, { onDelete: "cascade" })`
  - `month`: `text("month")` -- YYYY-MM format, for monthly goals
  - `targetUnit`: `text("target_unit")` -- free-text display label (e.g., "books", "km", "entries")
- [ ] Create `goalTallies` table in `src/db/schema.ts` with: `id`, `goalId` (FK → goals, CASCADE DELETE), `date`, `count` (default 1), `notes`, `createdAt`
- [ ] Run `npx drizzle-kit push` to apply schema changes
- [ ] Update `Goal` interface in `src/types/index.ts`: add `horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, `targetUnit` fields
- [ ] Add `GoalTally` interface to `src/types/index.ts`
- [ ] Verify existing goals display correctly after schema push (no data lost)

---

### Phase 2: API Layer

> Objective: Update existing goals endpoints to support new fields, add children and tally endpoints, update the progress endpoint to aggregate child goals and tallies.

#### Goals endpoint updates

- [ ] `GET /api/goals` -- add support for `?horizon=`, `?parentId=`, `?month=` query params in `src/app/api/goals/route.ts`
- [ ] `POST /api/goals` -- accept `horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, `targetUnit` in request body
- [ ] `PATCH /api/goals/:id` -- accept `horizon`, `parentGoalId`, `month`, `targetUnit` in `src/app/api/goals/[id]/route.ts`

#### Progress endpoint update

- [ ] `GET /api/goals/:id/progress` -- update `src/app/api/goals/[id]/progress/route.ts` to:
  - For yearly goals: sum activity logs and tallies from ALL child monthly sub-goals + direct logs + direct tallies
  - For tally-based goals (no `activityTypeId`): sum `goal_tallies.count` for the period
  - For yearly horizon: use year-to-date range (Jan 1 → today), return `paceStatus` ('ahead' | 'on_track' | 'behind' | 'no_data') based on elapsed% vs achieved%

#### New: Children endpoint

- [ ] Create `src/app/api/goals/[id]/children/route.ts`:
  - `GET`: return all monthly sub-goals for a yearly goal (goals where `parentGoalId = :id`), each with inline progress

#### New: Tally endpoints

- [ ] Create `src/app/api/goal-tallies/route.ts`:
  - `GET`: list tally entries, support `?goalId=`, `?from=`, `?to=` filters
  - `POST`: create a tally entry (`goalId`, `date`, `count`, `notes`)
- [ ] Create `src/app/api/goal-tallies/[id]/route.ts`:
  - `DELETE`: delete a tally entry by id

---

### Phase 3: Goal Form Updates

> Objective: Update the goal creation/edit form to support horizon selection, monthly linking, auto-generate benchmarks, and tally mode.

- [ ] Add **Horizon selector** at the top of `GoalFormStandalone` in `src/components/goals/goal-form-standalone.tsx`:
  - Three options: "Yearly Goal" | "Monthly Goal" | "Standalone" (default: Standalone to preserve existing behavior)
  - Only show yearly/monthly-specific fields when the relevant horizon is selected
- [ ] For **Yearly horizon**:
  - Show target value field with a unit/label field (e.g., "12 books", "500 km")
  - Show "Auto-generate monthly benchmarks" toggle (creates 12 monthly sub-goals on save)
  - Keep `sessionsPerWeek` as the yearly default
- [ ] For **Monthly horizon**:
  - Show month picker (YYYY-MM) defaulting to current month
  - Show optional "Link to yearly goal" dropdown (list of active yearly goals)
  - Show `sessionsPerWeek` specific to this month
  - Show target value field
- [ ] Handle `POST /api/goals` auto-generate: after creating a yearly goal with the toggle on, POST 12 monthly sub-goals (Jan–Dec of the goal's target year) with `targetValue = yearlyTarget / 12`
- [ ] Validate: monthly goals require a `month` value; yearly goals require a `targetValue` if tally-tracked

---

### Phase 4: Goals Dashboard UI

> Objective: Replace the flat list with a visual dashboard. This is the most significant UI change.

#### Dashboard layout

- [ ] Redesign `src/components/goals/goals-page.tsx` with three sections:
  1. **Yearly Goals grid** -- cards for all active yearly goals
  2. **This Month section** -- monthly goals for the current calendar month
  3. **Standalone Goals** -- compact list of goals with no horizon (unchanged behavior)
- [ ] Add a summary bar at the top: "X of Y yearly goals on track" (count goals with pace status = 'ahead' or 'on_track')
- [ ] The existing flat-list filter bar (Active / Completed / Archived / All) moves to a secondary "View All Goals" toggle that expands the full list below the dashboard sections

#### Yearly Goal Card component

- [ ] Create `src/components/goals/yearly-goal-card.tsx`:
  - Title, role badge(s), target display ("12 books / year")
  - Circular progress ring: current/target percentage using a simple SVG ring (no extra library needed)
  - Pace status badge: color-coded pill (green = Ahead/On Track, amber = Behind, gray = No Data)
  - Current month sub-goal inline: "March: 2 / 1" if a benchmark exists
  - "Log Progress" button (tally) always visible when no activity type is linked
  - Expand/collapse to show full monthly breakdown

#### Monthly Goal Card component

- [ ] Create `src/components/goals/monthly-goal-card.tsx`:
  - Compact card with horizontal progress bar, month label, target value, current count
  - Status badge: "On Track" / "Not Met" / "Achieved"
  - "Log Progress" button

#### Tally Logger component

- [ ] Create `src/components/goals/tally-logger.tsx`:
  - Mini-dialog: date picker (default today), count input (default 1, min 1), notes textarea
  - Confirms on save, shows a brief "Logged!" toast
  - List of past tallies (date, count, note) with delete button per entry

#### Monthly Breakdown component

- [ ] Create `src/components/goals/monthly-breakdown.tsx`:
  - Shown when a yearly goal is expanded
  - 12-month grid or list: each month shows benchmark target, actual progress, status dot
  - "Add Benchmark" button per empty month, "Edit" on existing ones

#### Loading & empty states

- [ ] Add loading skeletons for the dashboard (3 card placeholders per section)
- [ ] Empty state for the yearly goals section: prompt to create first yearly goal
- [ ] Empty state for the "This Month" section if no monthly goals exist for this month

---

### Phase 5: Scheduler Integration

> Objective: Make the monthly auto-scheduler aware of monthly benchmarks so it plans sessions based on what is needed this month, not the yearly default.

- [ ] In `src/app/api/schedule/generate/route.ts`:
  - After loading focus goals, for each goal query `GET /api/goals/:id/children?month=YYYY-MM` (current month)
  - If a matching monthly sub-goal exists, use its `sessionsPerWeek` value for scheduling that goal
  - Calculate remaining sessions: `monthlySessions = monthlySubGoal.sessionsPerWeek * weeksInMonth`, subtract already-completed sessions this month, spread remainder across remaining weeks
- [ ] Update `src/lib/scheduler.ts`:
  - Accept an optional `monthlyOverrides` map: `{ [goalId]: { sessionsPerWeek, remainingSessions } }`
  - When this map is provided, use it instead of the goal's base `sessionsPerWeek`
- [ ] Add a note to the schedule preview that indicates which goals are using a monthly benchmark override (e.g., "Using March benchmark: 5 sessions/week")

---

### Phase 6: Documentation Update

- [ ] Update `specs/master/data-model.md` with new `goals` columns and `goal_tallies` table
- [ ] Update `specs/master/contracts/api-routes.md` with new and modified endpoints
- [ ] Update `AGENT-ONBOARDING.md` to reflect Goals V2 in the "What's Built" table
- [ ] Update `specs/master/tasks.md` -- mark completed tasks as the build progresses

## Training vs Supplemental Session Split — Phases 1–6 (2026-05-11)

**Spec**: `Life App/feature requests/training-supplemental-split/spec.md`

- [x] Schema: `training_plans` split + dual preferred-day JSON columns; `training_phases` three content layers; `activities.session_type` — `apply-schema.js` idempotent alters + split backfill.
- [x] Types & helpers: `SessionType`, `TrainingPlanSplit`, `defaultSplit` / `isValidSplit` / `weeklySessionTargets` / `allocateSplitTotals` in `src/lib/training/split.ts`.
- [x] Climbing: `buildClimbingPhaseContent`, phase insert/restart/refresh-descriptions write layers; `POST`/`PATCH` training plans for split + preferred days.
- [x] Scheduler + generate route: split map, layered notes, `ProposedActivity.sessionType`; apply route persists `session_type`.
- [x] UI: climbing `TrainingPlanDialog` (split, weekday chips, create/edit, reconcile banner); Goals page + `TrainingPlanSection` **Edit plan**; regression test in `training-supplemental-split.test.ts` (restart split preservation); scheduler test for session tagging.

**Not done yet** (see feature `tasks.md`): full Phase 7 test matrix; any remaining doc polish (T035c-style entries). **Done:** Phases 5–6 — calendar/badge styling for supplemental rows; activity form session-type control; `sessionType` on `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH` activities.

---

**Manual tasks owned by the user** (per feature `tasks.md`): T033 integration walkthrough, T034 regression sweep.

---

## Activities Refactoring V1 — Phases 1–6 (2026-05-13)

**Spec**: `Life App/feature requests/activities-refactoring/spec.md`

Bridges the long-standing disconnect between scheduled `activities` and logged `activity_logs` without merging the two tables. Six small additive PRs against `master`, all merged.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Schema and renaming** (PR #4): Renamed `activities.is_log_entry` → `created_from_log` (idempotent `PRAGMA`-guarded `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` in `apply-schema.js`). Added `activity_types.default_duration_minutes` (NOT NULL DEFAULT 60). Updated Drizzle schema, `Activity` / `ActivityType` TypeScript types, and grep-and-replaced all `isLogEntry` call sites across API routes, scheduler, scheduler tests, and the day-column UI.
- [x] **Phase 2 — Server bridges** (PR #5): Extracted bridge logic into a pure, Drizzle-typed module `src/lib/activities-bridge.ts` with `applyCheckOffBridge`, `applyUnCheckBridge`, `applyDeleteBridge`, `parseBridgedLogAction`. Wired into `PATCH /api/activities/[id]` (check-off inserts a log idempotently using `default_duration_minutes`; un-check applies `bridgedLogAction` `delete` / `unlink` unconditionally) and `DELETE /api/activities/[id]` (returns `409 { linkedLogId }` when a linked log exists and no action is supplied, otherwise honors `?bridgedLogAction=`). `GET /api/activities` LEFT-JOINs `activity_logs` (user-scoped) to project the derived `linkedLogId` field; POST returns `linkedLogId: null` for shape parity. 23 unit tests in `src/lib/__tests__/activities-bridge.test.ts` covering insert, idempotency, unlink, delete, user-scope isolation, and the `bridgedLogAction` parser.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Calendar un-check dialog** (PR #6): New `src/components/activities/linked-log-action-dialog.tsx` (dual `mode: "uncheck" | "delete"` component, stacked option buttons + cancel). Wired un-check handler in `weekly-plan-view.tsx` and `daily-view.tsx` so the client opens the dialog purely off the `linkedLogId` it already has from GET (optimistic flow, no extra fetch). `daily-view.tsx` re-fetches `activityLogs` after a bridged un-check so workout history reflects the user's choice immediately.
- [x] **Phase 4 — WorkoutLog goal picker** (PR #7): Added an "(optional) Goal" select to the manual Log Activity tab (`src/components/activities/workout-log.tsx`), populated from `GET /api/goals?status=active`, hidden when the user has no active goals. The selected `goalId` is sent verbatim on `POST /api/activity-logs`.
- [x] **Phase 5 — Calendar Schedule Activity gate removal + role auto-fill** (PR #8): Removed the role-based goal filter in `src/components/monthly-plan/activity-form.tsx` so the goal picker is no longer hidden when the role select is empty. Picking a goal now auto-fills the role select with the goal's first linked role when role is currently unset, removing a common silent UX dead-end.
- [x] **Phase 6 — Activity-type editor default duration** (PR #9): Added a "Default Duration (minutes)" number input (always visible, helper text explaining the bridge use) to `src/components/activities/sport-form.tsx` with client-side positive-integer validation. Wired `defaultDurationMinutes` through `POST` and `PATCH /api/activity-types`.

**Verification across all phases**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, 228 passing tests with no regressions, `npm run lint` baseline (41 errors / 12 warnings, all pre-existing) unchanged.

**Manual tasks owned by the user** (per feature `tasks.md`): T018 climbing-happy-path integration walkthrough, T019 regression sweep (tennis/running existing plans, generic activity without type, `goal_tallies` untouched).

**Deferred**: A V2 "table unification" candidate (collapsing `activities` and `activity_logs` into one schema) was considered and deferred — the surgical V1 bridge model preserves the existing semantic split (scheduled time blocks vs logged workouts) and was sufficient for every user-visible disconnect we identified.

## Scheduler & Goal Form Fixes (completed)

- [x] Training plan availability extended to standalone goals (was yearly-only). Updated condition in `goal-form-standalone.tsx` and save payload.
- [x] Bug fix: Scheduled activities now inherit `activityTypeId` from their linked goal. Added `activityTypeId` field to `ProposedActivity` interface in `scheduler.ts`, populated it in `commitSession()` from `goal.activityTypeId`.
- [x] Bug fix: `POST /api/schedule/generate` was not fetching `activityTypeId` from the goals table. Added it to the SQL select and mapped goal objects.
- [x] Bug fix: `POST /api/schedule/apply` was not persisting `activityTypeId` when inserting activities. Added it to the insert values.
- [x] Auto-seeding of defaults: Roles, activity types, and spending categories are now auto-seeded when their respective tables are empty (on first API GET call). Added `seedDefaultRoles()`, `seedDefaultActivityTypes()`, `seedDefaultCategories()` to API route handlers.
- [x] Spending category defaults extracted to `src/lib/defaults.ts` (`DEFAULT_SPENDING_CATEGORIES`).
- [x] Default goal horizon changed from "Standalone" to "Yearly" in `goal-form-standalone.tsx`, with auto-filled target date (Dec 31 of current year).

| 2026-05-13 | Activities Refactoring V1 | Renamed `activities.is_log_entry` → `created_from_log`; added `activity_types.default_duration_minutes`. New schedule-to-log bridge in `activities-bridge.ts` wired into `PATCH /api/activities/:id` (check-off inserts an idempotent log; un-check honors `bridgedLogAction`) and `DELETE /api/activities/:id` (409 + `linkedLogId` when a linked log exists and no `bridgedLogAction` is supplied). `GET /api/activities` projects derived `linkedLogId`. New `LinkedLogActionDialog` drives optimistic un-check / delete prompts. WorkoutLog goal picker, calendar Schedule Activity goal-picker gate removal with role auto-fill, and activity-type editor default-duration input. Six PRs (#4–#9) on master. |
| 2026-05-15 | Role Scheduling Rules Removal | Dropped `roles.max_weekly_occurrences` and `roles.min_rest_days` columns (idempotent migration in `apply-schema.js`), schema/types/defaults/seed cleaned, role form's "max times per week" and "min rest days" inputs removed, and the `violatesRestConstraints` function plus its two call sites in `scheduler.ts` deleted. Goal-level `sessionsPerWeek` and `schedulerSettings.maxActivitiesPerDay` now own scheduling caps. Added server-side `[1, 7]` clamp on `POST` and `PATCH /api/goals` via new `clampSessionsPerWeek` helper (the form already enforces the same bounds). Two obsolete scheduler tests removed; two new tests cover SC-001 (sessionsPerWeek=7 places 7) and Acceptance 1.3 (consecutive-day placement allowed). New `goal-validation` test file covers the clamp (12 cases). |
| 2026-05-15 | Habit Tracking Phase 1 (foundation) | New `habits` table (11 cols) and `habit_logs` table (5 cols) in `apply-schema.js` and Drizzle schema. Unique index `habit_logs_habit_date_unique` on `(habit_id, date)` enforces at-most-one log per day. TypeScript types: `Habit`, `HabitLog`, `HabitWithRecentLogs`, `HabitDraft`. New `formatDateForDisplay(iso)` helper converts ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` to user-facing `DD-MM-YYYY`. New `computeStreaks(dates, today)` helper in `src/lib/habit-streaks.ts` computes `{ current, best }` client-side -- server returns raw `recentLogDates` (last 30 days) and never decides what today is. API: `GET`/`POST /api/habits`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/habits/:id`, `PUT /api/habits/reorder`, `POST`/`DELETE /api/habit-logs` (both idempotent -- POST always 201, DELETE always 204). 17 new unit tests. PR #17. Phases 2-4 (UI, manage, polish) pending. |
| 2026-05-15 | Habit Tracking Phases 2-4 (UI + manage + polish) | Phase 2: sidebar nav, /habits page, HabitList client component, HabitRow, 14-day HabitStrip (DD-MM-YYYY tooltip, per-cell in-flight guard), optimistic toggle with inline affirmation, HabitForm (quick + 5-step walkthrough state machine). Phase 3: kebab menu per row, edit flow (PATCH + archive button in form), archive/restore (optimistic), hard delete with HabitDeleteDialog, drag-to-reorder via @dnd-kit/sortable (PointerSensor + KeyboardSensor, PUT /api/habits/reorder). Phase 4: HabitEmptyState editorial block (three house-voice principles, CTA inversion). 12 new walkthrough state-machine tests. PRs #19, #20, #21. Feature complete. |
